# Kotlin-Dagger2-Retrofit2-example
An example project showing how to use Kotlin with Dagger 2 and Retrofit 2. It uses [Pokeapi](http://pokeapi.co/docs/) to show a list of pokemons with details(Details part still in progress). 

This is a port of another example project to Kotlin.  If you want to check the original project, written in java, you can find it [here](https://github.com/infinum/Dagger-2-Example)
